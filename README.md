# OnlineAdSystem
This is a super duper simple web app that allows users to place orders for ad. Certain users have special packages, hence upon choosing username, server sends user specific promotions. Client then calculates price accordingly and display to user.

To keep this simple, information which is supposed to be retrieved a DB is stored in the mockDB folder.

## Setup
```
1. git clone
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. go to browser -> `localhost:3000`
